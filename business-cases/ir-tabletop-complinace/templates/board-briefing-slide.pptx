**Ransomware Incident Drill: Executive Summary**

---

### 1. Incident Overview

* **Date & Time (T+0):** IDS alert at 09:15 UTC
* **Scope:** “DB-FR-01” ransomware + exfiltration of \~10 k EU customer records

---

### 2. Key Metrics

| Metric                       | Value          | Target / Threshold | Status    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Time to Detect (MTTD)        | 2 hrs          | ≤1 hr              | 🔶 Yellow |
| Time to Contain              | 4 hrs          | ≤4 hrs             | 🟢 Green  |
| Records Exfiltrated          | 10,000         | 0                  | 🔴 Red    |
| GDPR Notification Sent (T+x) | T+48 hrs draft | ≤72 hrs            | 🟢 Green  |

● Include a small sparkline or RAG icon next to each metric.

### 3. Timeline & Milestones

A horizontal swim-lane graphic showing:

* **T+0:** Detection
* **T+1:** Backup alert
* **T+2:** Ransom note
* **T+24:** Forensics / exfiltration finds
* **T+48:** GDPR draft sent
* **T+72:** Final notification to regulator

---

### 4. Top Findings & Risks

* **Delayed lateral-movement detection** → increases dwell time
* **Unpatched critical vulns (7 > threshold 5)**
* **Threat intel coverage only 72% vs 80% target**

---

### 5. Recommendations & Decisions Needed

1. **Automate IR playbook:** Integrate SIEM alerts → orchestration
2. **Accelerate patching SLA:** Target ≤15 days for critical CVEs
3. **Expand threat intel feeds** to hit ≥80% coverage
4. **Approve budget** for IR tooling and staff training

### Design Tips

* **Keep text minimal:** 4–6 bullet points per section
* **Use consistent icons/colors:** RAG status (🟢🟡🔴)
* **Visualize metrics:** small bar/sparkline charts where possible
* **One “ask” box:** highlight any approvals or funding requests

By populating your slide with these sections—clear metrics up top, a concise timeline, highlighted risks, and calls to action—you’ll give the board exactly what they need to know in < 5 minutes.
