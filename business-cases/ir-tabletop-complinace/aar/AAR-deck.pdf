### 1. Title Slide

* **Title:** After-Action Review – Ransomware Tabletop Drill
* **Subtitle:** NIST CSF & GDPR Exercise | \[Date]
* **Facilitator / Author:** \[Your Name / Team]

---

### 2. Exercise Overview

* **Objective:** Test IR playbook vs. NIST CSF and GDPR timelines
* **Scope:** Ransomware on EU database (DB-FR-01), data exfiltration of \~10k PII records
* **Participants:** SOC, IR Lead, Legal, PR, Business Owner, CISO

---

### 3. Timeline Recap

* A **swimlane** or horizontal timeline graphic showing key injects and actions at:

  * T+0: Detection alert
  * T+1: Backup alert
  * T+2: Ransom note
  * T+8: External intel
  * T+24: Forensics report & GDPR trigger
  * T+48: GDPR draft sent
  * T+72: Expected notification deadline

### 4. Key Findings

| Finding                                    | Impact Level | Control / Reg. Reference | Notes                 |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Delayed lateral-move detection             | High         | NIST DE.DP-4             | IDS rules need tuning |
| Unpatched critical vulnerabilities (7 > 5) | High         | NIST PR.IP-12            | Patch process gaps    |
| Threat intel coverage at 72% vs 80% target | Medium       | NIST RS.AN-5             | Expand intel sources  |

*(Use RAG colors or icons next to each row)*

### 5. Control & Regulation Mapping

* A **matrix** mapping each top finding to the relevant NIST CSF function/sub-category and the GDPR article (33/34) it tests.
* Example table:

  | Finding                        | NIST CSF Category  | Specific Sub-Category | GDPR Article |
  | ------------------------------ | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------ |
  | Lateral movement detection lag | Detect (DE.DP-4)   | Continuous monitoring | 33           |
  | Patch gaps                     | Protect (PR.IP-12) | Configuration mgmt    | —            |
  | Intel coverage shortfall       | Respond (RS.AN-5)  | Analysis              | 34           |

---

### 6. Root-Cause Analysis

* **Fishbone** or bullet list of underlying causes for each finding:

  * E.g., “No automated SIEM alert for internal SMB traffic”
  * “Patching exceptions process not enforced”

---

### 7. POAM Snapshot

* **Screenshot** or recreated chart of your POAM dashboard (from `aar/POAM-dashboard.png`) showing:

  * Finding
  * Risk rating
  * Owner
  * Target completion
  * Status (RAG)

---

### 8. Recommendations

* **Top 3–5 action items**, each with owner and target date.

  1. Automate lateral-move detection rules (SOC Manager; 30 Jun)
  2. Enforce patch exceptions policy (IT Ops; 15 Jul)
  3. Integrate 2 new threat-intel feeds (IR Lead; 01 Aug)
  4. Update GDPR notification template (Legal; 10 Jun)

---

### 9. Lessons Learned & Next Steps

* **What went well:** e.g., rapid containment decision, clear role assignments.
* **Opportunities:** e.g., streamline notification approvals, improve forensic tool usage.
* **Next Steps:** schedule full-scale drill, update playbooks, train staff.

### 10. Appendix (Optional)

* Detailed logs, full inject list, raw anonymized timeline data.
