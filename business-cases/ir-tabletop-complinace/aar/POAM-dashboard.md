* **Findings / Gaps**: A brief description or identifier for each issue uncovered (e.g., “Delayed lateral-move detection,” “Unpatched Critical Vulns”).
* **Risk Rating**: High/Medium/Low or a numerical score, often color-coded (🔴/🟡/🟢).
* **Owner**: The individual or team responsible for remediating each item.
* **Target Date**: When the remediation is due.
* **Status**: Current progress (Not Started/In Progress/Complete), again with RAG coloring.

You might represent this as:

* A **traffic-light table** like above.
* Or a **bar/stacked-bar chart** showing the count of items by status and risk level.
* Or a **Gantt-style bar chart** with each finding’s timeline from “Open” to “Due Date.”

The goal is a **single graphic** that conveys at a glance where your greatest risks remain, who owns each action, and whether you’re on track to meet your deadlines.
